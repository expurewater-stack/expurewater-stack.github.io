# 📄 GitHub Pages Test

If you can read this page at a URL like:

https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

✅ **GitHub Pages is working correctly.**

---

## 🔧 What This Confirms

- GitHub Pages is enabled
- The repository is publishing correctly
- Markdown rendering works
- Custom domain (if configured) resolves properly

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository is currently using:

- `README.md` → main page content
- No build tools
- No static site generator

This is ideal for a **quick test or placeholder site**.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

You can upgrade this into a full documentation site using:
- MkDocs
- Docusaurus
- Jekyll
- Hugo

Or keep it simple and use Markdown-only pages.
